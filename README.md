# 🛒 Power BI E-Commerce Sales Performance Dashboard

## 🧠 Background & Business Context
This project simulates the analytics function of an **E-Commerce company** seeking real-time visibility into sales and profit performance.  
As part of a complete BI workflow, SQL was used to extract and prepare data from a relational database, while Power BI was leveraged to model, visualize, and deliver **actionable business insights**.

The dashboard serves as an executive analytics hub — helping business leaders monitor **sales growth, profitability trends, customer segments, and regional performance** with interactive and dynamic visuals.

- Tracks **Year-to-Date (YTD)** performance across key business KPIs (Sales, Profit, Quantity, Margin).  
- Enables **drill-down analysis** by product, region, and customer segment.  
- Provides **real-time insights** into business trends through automated DAX measures and dynamic visuals.  
- Demonstrates how Power BI and SQL can be integrated into a seamless **data-to-decision** pipeline.
